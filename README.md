Title: Predicting Solar Flare Intensity Using Time Series Forecasting with Transformers

Group members (max 4): [Your Name]

Short description (a few sentences): I will develop a transformer-based model to predict solar flare intensity based on temporal patterns in solar activity data. The project will explore how attention mechanisms can capture long-range dependencies in solar magnetic field measurements to forecast potentially hazardous solar events. I will compare the performance of transformer architectures against traditional time series forecasting methods like LSTM and statistical approaches.
